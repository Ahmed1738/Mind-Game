# Mind-Game
Mind Game is a command-line Java application developed for SOFTENG 281 (Assignment 2) that pits a human player against an AI opponent (HAL-9000) in a colour-guessing game focused on prediction, adaptation, and scoring strategy. Each round, both players choose a colour (RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW) and guess the opponent’s colour; +1 point is awarded for a correct guess, with an additional +2 bonus if the correct guess matches the randomly selected Power Colour on every third round. The game supports multiple difficulty levels via clean object-oriented design patterns. An AI Factory (static creator) instantiates the appropriate AI for EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD, while a Strategy interface underpins three behaviours: Random (fully random choice/guess), AvoidLast (never guesses the human’s previous colour), and LeastUsed (guesses the colour the human has used least so far, tie-breaking by canonical order). MEDIUM begins Random, then switches to AvoidLast from round two onward; HARD begins Random, moves to LeastUsed on round three, and then dynamically toggles between AvoidLast and LeastUsed based on the previous round’s outcome via setStrategy. The implementation emphasises clean separation of concerns, testability, and spec-accurate console output using MessageCli. Input is validated case-insensitively (full names or initials), invalid entries trigger helpful prompts, and the game prevents PLAY before NEW_GAME. Power Colour selection and AI randomness use provided utilities (Utils, Colour), supporting deterministic seeds for reproducible testing while remaining robust to arbitrary seeds. State is instance-based (no non-final statics), ensuring tests pass in batch without shared leakage. Commands include NEW_GAME <DIFFICULTY> <ROUNDS>, PLAY, and SHOW_STATS, with automatic end-of-game summaries and winner/tie announcements. Built with Java, Maven, and JUnit; structured for readability and maintainability, with small, focused classes that demonstrate Strategy and Factory patterns in practice.
